I am writing to submit an article entitled "Properties and Bayesian fitting of restricted Boltzmann machines" for consideration for publication in the Journal of the American Statistical Association - Theory & Methods.  In this submission, we discuss the relationship between parameter specification and unattractive model properties---degeneracy, instability and uninterpretability---in restricted Boltzmann machines and describe related difficulties that can arise in likelihood-based and Bayes fitting of such models.
 
This paper references results from another manuscript, an invited revision of which is presently under review by Technometrics. We have provided a blinded copy of this second manuscript as a supplement for referees.
 
Thank you for your consideration.
